# User testing

### What

__User testing__ is the assessment of the usability of your app or website by testing it with real users.

User testing is not the same as __market research__, which is a form of collecting opinions. It informs the early stages of development by assessing the validity of the target audience, the underlying business model and the level of competition.

User testing includes the following five components:  

- __Learnability__: How easy is it for users to accomplish basic tasks the first time they encounter the design?  
- __Efficiency__: How fast can experienced users accomplish tasks?  
- __Memorability__: When users return to the design after a period of not using it, does the user remember enough to use it effectively the next time, or does the user have to start over again learning everything?  
- __Errors__: How many errors do users make, how severe are these errors and how easily can they recover from the errors?  
- __Emotional response__: How does the user feel about using the product? Would they recommend it to a friend?

### Why

Because usability is the most important aspect of a user-centered product!

User testing:
- identifies any usability problems  
  - _40% of users abandon the website if it takes more than 3 seconds to load_
- determines user satisfaction
- provides you the knowledge to make your product more desirable (and beat the competition!)
- reduces development costs, if done in an agile way *
  - _50% of engineering time is spent on rework that could be avoided_

\* In a typical waterfall flow, the high-level test planning and the writing of the test cases are done after the completion of the project by the QA (quality assurance) personnel. In contrast, in a typical agile project the testing is much more integrated and is done throughout the project. As a result, potential problems are diagnosed and fixed early on in the development process, reducing the costs.

### How
- quantitative vs. qualitative data
