## Jobs To Be Done (JTBD)

### What is JTBD?

JTBD is a task-centred framework for designing user experiences. It is an alternative to the customer-focused framework of personas, user journeys and user stories. One of its key concepts is that people 'hire' products to do jobs in their lives.

Customer-focused frameworks rely on the premise that demographic details and personas inform people's purchasing behaviours. However, this is not necessarily the case. Someone's demographic attributes often do not explain why they choose to purchase or use a particular product.

### How is JTBD implemented?

In a customer-focused framework, a user story will be in the following format:

> As a [persona/role] I want to [action] so that [outcome/benefit].

In contrast, the JTBD framework would use a job story in the following format:

> When [users work/life context] I want to [motivation] so that [outcome/benefit].

This subtle shift moves attention away from demographic details, and instead places the focus on the specific task being performed.

Instead of approaching your design in terms of user journeys that address user stories, you would consider the _job_ journeys that would allow users to achieve each of the product's _job stories_.

As JTBD is only interested in the 'why' and 'what' of a task, there is no need for personas (the 'who').
