# What is the difference between a Journey and a Story?

## User Story

This is a short, simple description of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system.
User stories work well for the product **functionality**.

It typically follows a simple template:

```
“**As a** ‘type of user’,
 **I want** ‘some goal’
 **so that** ‘some reason’.”
```

## User Journey

A user journey is a series of steps (typically 4-12) which represent a scenario in which a user might interact with the thing you are designing. They can be used for 2 main things:

* Demonstrating the way users **currently** interact with the service / website / product
* Demonstrating the way users **could** interact with the service / website / product

## How a User Story is Different from a User Journey

This does depend on the context of its usage but a User Story is based on a specific user, so this could cater for a particular type of user to answer a specific problem whereas a User Journey can be a random user that may use the web app.

**Note: Based on context, a User Journey and Story can be one and the same.**
