# usability and accessibility

Intro


## usability

__What is usability?__
Web usability is the ease of use of a website:
 - The presentation of information and choices in a clear and concise way.
 - Lack of ambiguity and the placement of important items in appropriate areas.
 - Ensuring that the content works on various devices and browsers.
 - Ensuring that the website is appropriate for all ages and genders.

__Key principles to achieve usability:__
  1. Availability and Accessibility - if someone tries to access your site and it doesn't work for some reason, then your website becomes worthless.
  2. Clarity - users visit your site for a specific goal, do not confuse the user and help them reach their goal as quick as possible.
  3. Learnability - aim for an intuitive interface, an interface that doesn't require instructions. the key to intuitive design is to either use what people already know or create something that is easy to learn.
  4. Credibility - if the user doesn't trust you, the content on the website is worthless.
  make sure the site has an About us page including contact details.
  5. Relevancy - It is not enough that your website is clear, your content must also be relevant.

### What is accessibility?

The World Wide Web Consortium defines web accessibility as an attribute through which “people with disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the web, and they can contribute to the web”.

Web accessibility includes all types of disabilities that impact access to the web and thus includes visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive and neurological disabilities and adherence to web accessibility principles also benefits elderly users.

So as to improve web site accessibility, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has set up the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) which publishes the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) – a set of guidelines with the aim of making the web content more accessible to people with disabilities and indirectly to users in general.


This might include:

- Users of screen readers (blind or partially-sighted users)
- Color blind users
- Users with hearing impairments
- Users with low dexterity
- Users with terrible computers (!)


### A few simple steps towards accessibility

- Alt text on images
- Color contrast (accessibility for users with colour blindness)
- Indicate language of the page in HTML page head (or around sections of text on your page that are in another language, or around abbreviations) for screen readers (```lang="en_gb"```)
- Resizeable text
- Labels on forms (useful guidelines [here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/guidelines/futuremedia/accessibility/html/form-labels.shtml  ))
- Semantic HTML tags and IDs
- Role attribute in HTML (gives information to screen readers, e.g. tablist)
- Transcripts for audio files
- All functionality available via keyboard, e.g. tabbing or using arrow keys to navigate around (some users can't use a mouse - use tabindex!)
- Consider users with dyslexia when deciding on line-height / text alignment / font
