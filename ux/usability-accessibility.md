Intro


## usability

__What is usability?__
Web usability is the ease of use of a website:
 - The presentation of information and choices in a clear and concise way.
 - Lack of ambiguity and the placement of important items in appropriate areas.
 - Ensuring that the content works on various devices and browsers.
 - Ensuring that the website is appropriate for all ages and genders.

__Key principles to achieve usability:__
  1. Availability and Accessibility - if someone tries to access your site and it doesn't work for some reason, then your website becomes worthless.
  2. Clarity - users visit your site for a specific goal, do not confuse the user and help them reach their goal as quick as possible.
  3. Learnability - aim for an intuitive interface, an interface that doesn't require instructions. the key to intuitive design is to either use what people already know or create something that is easy to learn.
  4. Credibility - if the user doesn't trust you, the content on the website is worthless.
  make sure the site has an About us page including contact details.
  5. Relevancy - It is not enough that your website is clear, your content must also be relevant.
