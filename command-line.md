### What is Bash? ###

Short answer: **Bash is a Unix shell**.

 - A ** shell** is a user interface for access to an operating system's services. It is an example of a command-line interface (CLI), as opposed to the graphical user interface (GUI). It is named a shell because it is a layer around the operating system kernel. Shells may be used interactively, with input typed from the keyboard in the text window, or non-interactively, reading commands from a file (a script).

- **Unix shell** is a shell that provides a traditional Unix-like command line user interface.

- **Unix** is a family of multitasking, multiuser computer operating systems. Unix-like operating systems include OS X and Linux (Ubuntu).
