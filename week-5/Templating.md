## Templating

### What is a templating engine and why would you use it? (group1)

### What is Handlebars.js? (group1)

- One of the most popular JavaScript templating engines
- Not specific to Hapi or Node.js, can be used for any JS templating
- Builds on top of Mustache templating engine
- In Hapi, handlebars can be used as the engine for rendering `html` templates

As in Mustache, handlebars templates look like regular HTML, with embedded placeholders (e.g. `{{expression}}`).

``` html
<body>
  <h1>{{title}}</h1>
  <section>
    {{introduction}}
  </section>
</div>
```

In Hapi, parameters that are provided by the client request are available in the `query` object.

``` html
<div>{{query.paramName}}</div>
```

Handlebars provides additional helpers (functions used within templates), such as:
- `{{#with}}` helper takes an object and then allows you to refer to its properties
- `{{#each}}` helper allows you to loop through an object's properties

To implement custom helpers, these can be provided a in separate `js` file and exported using `module.exports`. The name of each helper file will be used as the helper name in the template.

When configuring `server.views`, the `helpersPath` property is used to let Hapi know where to find our custom handlebars helpers.

### Additional - What are the advantages of using server side rendering vs rendering dynamic content on the client? (group 1)

**Server-side rendering**: server renders the HTML page before sending it to the client  
**Client-script rendering**: JavaScript running in the browser produces HTML or manipulates the DOM

Benefits of server side rendering:
- Your content is visible to search engines like Google
- The page loads faster. There is no delay between retrieving the server response and rendering the page
- It maintains the idea that pages are documents. If you ask a server for a document by URL, you get back the text of the document rather than instructions on how to manipulate the document

Benefits of client-side rendering:
- You can update the screen instantly when the user clicks, rather than waiting for the server to respond
- Great for animated or highly interactive content

Note that the two are not mutually exclusive. Most websites will use both server-side and client-side rendering, with static, navigable content being rendered on the server, app-like interactivity being handled by the code running in the browser.

### Example

- examples of view engines (e.g. jade, handlebars. esx etc)
- Vision adds view methods
- The views method is used to configure
- Views takes a single argument with is object containing engines key which is itself an object- a mapping of file extensions to view engines (e.g. 'html: require('handlebars')... ') hbs?.
- Views needs a path of where to find views, 'relateTo: "__dirname"' (directory of where views located), and path, which is relative to the directory (e.g. views).
- All of these steps are rquired before adding routes to serve the views
- inside the handler, the view method is added to the reply object ()
- view takes a first name as the view method (e.g. home, no need for home.html if view engine set for html).
- HBS files use {{ }} syntax...
- optional path parameters can be added in the path . e.g. '/{name?}', the name parameter will be available in the params object in the request object.
- reply.view('home', { name: request.params.name || world, }).
- By setting layout to true, you can create a layout file (e.g. layout.hbs), which uses {{{content}}} as the placeholder view
