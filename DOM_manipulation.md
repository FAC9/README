#This is DOM manipulation README

## What is a node in the DOM?
The **"DOM"** is a tree structure that represents the HTML of the website, and **every HTML element** within that is a **"node"**.
## What different types of node are there?
There are several different types of DOM nodes, the most important are 'Element', 'Text' and 'Document'.

* An **'Element' node** represents an element within a page. E.g. a paragraph element ```<p>``` Also note that element attributes are DOM nodes themselves.

* A **'Text' node** represents all text (within elements) within a page. So if your paragraph has a bit of text in it can be directly accessed through the DOM.

* The **'Document' node** represents the entire document. (it's the root-node of the DOM hierarchy/tree).
