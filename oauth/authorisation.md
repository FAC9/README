# What are Authorisation Scopes?

__Authorization__
- Authorization is the process of giving someone permission to do or have something.

__Authorization scopes__
- A scope is a specific string that indicates a list of permissions
- If you are an app, they let your specify what type of access you need
- If you are a user, they determine what data you give the app permission to access
- Scopes determine which objects / resources the access is granted to, and what type of access it is (e.g. read, write)
- Requested scopes will be displayed to the user on the authorize form
- An example list of authorization scopes for a social network:  
`post_to_my_wall  send_notification  post_to_my_friends_wall  read_my_age`
