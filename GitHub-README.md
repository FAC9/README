Milestones -
  Essentially milestones are a way of organising a number of github issues which need to be resolved by a certain deadline. Once a milestone has been created, issues can be assigned to it. The idea being that once all these issues have been resolved, then milestone has been reached.

  This is an effective way of tracking progress on a project, and seeing which issues need to be prioritised for upcoming deadlines.

  Milestones could be used for Alpha, Beta, Release etc. Milestones could be created in a more or less granular fashion as you see fit.

Labels -
  'Labels can be applied to issues and pull requests to signify priority, category, or any other information that you find useful.'


Creating Milestones and Labels -
  Both Milestones and Labels can be managed under your repo's issues tab.

  To create a milestone click on milestone, then on new milestone

  Once you have created a milestone and assigned issues to it you will see a progress tracker like This

  As issues are resolved this progress bar will start to fill up.
