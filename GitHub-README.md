## Documenting projects in github
Good documentation is key to the success of any project.
Making documentation accessible enables people to learn about a project;
making it easy to update ensures that documentation stays relevant.

Two common ways to document a project are README files and wikis:

README files are a quick and simple way for other users to learn more about
your work.

Wikis on GitHub help you present in-depth information about your project
in a useful way.

It’s a good idea to at least have a README on your project, because
it’s the first thing many people will read when they first find your
work.

### Creating your README
When you create a new repository though GitHub, select “Initialize this
repository with a README” unless you plan to import an existing repository.

Your README.md file is now available for editing in your brand-new repository.
Your project’s name is at the top, followed by any description you chose to
include when creating the repository. READMEs are easy to modify, both on
GitHub or locally. Check out the Mastering Markdown guide to learn more about
how to modify the text within the file after you’ve made it.

### Creating your wiki
Every repository on GitHub comes with a wiki. After you’ve created a
repository, you can set up the included wiki through the sidebar navigation.
Starting your wiki is simply a matter of clicking the wiki button and
creating your first page.

## Milestones and Labels

### Milestones
Essentially milestones are a way of organising a number of github issues
which need to be resolved by a certain deadline. Once a milestone has been
created, issues can be assigned to it. The idea being that once all these
issues have been resolved, then milestone has been reached.

This is an effective way of tracking progress on a project, and seeing which
issues need to be prioritised for upcoming deadlines.

Milestones could be used for Alpha, Beta, Release etc. Milestones could be
created in a more or less granular fashion as you see fit.

### Labels
Labels are applied to issues, and are fundamentally a categorisation tool. While there are pre-existing labels provided by GitHub, you can create custom labels to fit your needs.

Labels can be searched, and can be used by developers to find problems that match their areas of expertise.

### Creating Milestones and Labels
Both Milestones and Labels can be managed under your repo's issues tab.

To create a milestone click on milestone, then on new milestone

  Once you have created a milestone and assigned issues to it you will see a
   progress tracker like This

  As issues are resolved this progress bar will start to fill up. You can click
  on the milestone to see the issues in greater detail

### Get agile with it.
Milestones are a fun and cool way to do Agile things on github. You can imagine that a milestone is like a sprint. A cool sprint.
