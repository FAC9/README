Git versus GitHub
=================

## Git

Git is a distributed version control system (VCS). Version control systems are used to track and share changes (commits) to documents in a repository. 'Distributed' means that each person using the repository has a complete copy of it on their computer, rather than relying on a separate server to hold all of the information.

* non-linear - branching structure
* distributed - each developer has copy of full development history
* fast and scalable

Index/cache vs object database

Push changes to a common repository. This could be GitHub, but it could also be e.g. Heroku hosting. If you want to share with others, they just need to have access to the repo in order to pull changes. But you don't /need/ to use Github. Pull/push from each other's computers. But what if you can't access the person's computer?

## GitHub

GitHub is a hosting service for git repositories. Used for backup and collaboration.

You can choose which branches to put on GitHub.

Offers all of git's features and adds more for collaboration:

bug tracking, feature requests, task management, wikis.

Core function is hosting, but real power comes from collaboration tools.
