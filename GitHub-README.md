Git versus GitHub
=================

## Git

Git is a distributed version control system. Version control is used to track and share changes (known as 'commits') to documents in a 'repository'. 'Distributed' means that each developer has a complete copy of the repository on their computer and there is no need to rely on a central server to track changes.

The basic process when using Git is to commit code changes to a branch of a repository. Keeping workflows in separate branches means that multiple people can be working on different parts of the codebase at once. Once the work in a branch is completed, it should be merged into the central, master branch.

Once you've committed your changes, how do you share them? Git is designed so that you can easily `pull` changes that other people have made and `push` your own. You might do this by allowing collaborators to ssh into the repository on your computer, or by pushing all of your changes to a repository on a local server you all have access to.

This might work fine if you have access to the other people's computers, but what if you don't? What if you don't even know who the collaborators might be? This is where GitHub comes in.

## GitHub

GitHub is a hosting service for git repositories. Used for backup and collaboration.

You can choose which branches to put on GitHub.

Offers all of git's features and adds more for collaboration:

bug tracking, feature requests, task management, wikis.

Core function is hosting, but real power comes from collaboration tools.
